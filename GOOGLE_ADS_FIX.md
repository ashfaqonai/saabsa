# Google Ads Fix: Sitelink Error & Ad Strength Improvement

## 🚨 Current Issues

### Issue 1: Sitelink Text Error
**Error**: "This asset is too long" - 31/25 characters

**Problem**: You put the full URL (`https://www.saabsa.com/services`) in the **"Sitelink text"** field, but that field needs SHORT TEXT only (max 25 characters).

**Solution**: 
- **Sitelink text** = Short text like "Services" (NOT the URL)
- **Sitelink URL** = The full URL like `https://www.saabsa.com/services.html`
